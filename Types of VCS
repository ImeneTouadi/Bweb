  Local Version Control Systems
Local Version Control System is a local database located in your own computer, it operates without the need of a central server. Therefore, the changes made are not automatically shared with other members, which makes collaboration with other team members extremely challenging. 
Local Version Control Systems are designed for individuaul use; the changes are stored and tracked locally, thereby, the restore process is nearly impossible: if anything happened to a version of your project, all the changes that have occured after that version would be lost. And if something hqppened to the local database, all the patches would be lost. [https://serengetitech.com/tech/introduction-to-git-and-types-of-version-control-systems/]
